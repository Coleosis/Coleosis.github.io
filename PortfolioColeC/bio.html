  <h3>Hello, my name is...</h3>
  <h1>Cole Carlson</h1>
  <p>Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio. This site will show you who I am, the work I have done, and how to contact me.
      I am always open for new experiences, job opportunites, and any adventures to have me learn and grow more as a human being, and professional.
  </p>
  <h3>Anecdote</h3>
  <p>I have lived in Idaho for over a decade, and this is where I started my family and my educational career.
    My passions include but aren't limited to: computers, music, animals, science and food. I have always been interested in 
    software and tech since I was in elementary school. Currently I study Software Development at College of Western Idaho 
    and have general knowledge in C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages finishing an Associates Degree. My goal is to never stop
    learning and take all the advantageous opportunities that come my way.
  </p>
