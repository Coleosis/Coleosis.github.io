            <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
            <p>I was born in Seattle WA, and was raised in Boston, MA ... for awhile, and then I attended high school in Spokane, WA. My family 
                moved quite often, you know, Costco Wholesale family. I have played musical instruments all of my life starting with piano
                and working my way to guitar, singing, bass and drums. Video games through the years and the invention of 
                the internet has opened me up to my passion for coding. Music and technology have always been "my thing", and has been a dominant
                part of my life throughout. I have an awesome and crazy son and a wonderful partner in the health science field 
                (maybe she can set me up with a medical coding job?) and I reside in Boise, ID.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>After earning my associates degree I plan on solidifying a reliable and well paying job where I will hone my craft. I plan on pursuing my own creative 
                coding projects while working, which truthfully was the starting point for me to begin learning about high-end languages. I am excited to see where 
                my degree and my passion takes me.
